# [Interação](https://fatequino.com.br/construcao-do-fatequino/interacao/)

This project's module goal is to develop a chatbot that can provide information about Fatec Carapicuíba's university to the user. If you have any difficulty installing the required software, please check the documentation at the "README_COMPLIMENT" file.


## Instalation

To start Fatequino's chatbot in your machine, you'll need the following softwares:

- MongoDB, versão 4.x.x
- Python3, versão 3.7.x
- pip, versão 19.x.x

### MongoDB

MongoDB Server is the database system used by the application.

To install it, follow the official documentation: [Install MongoDb Server Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

### Python3 and Pip

Python is the programming language used to develop the chatbot.

To install it, you can follow the instructions at its official website: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Along with Python, you'll have the `pip` tool installed. This tool is used to manage Python application's dependencies.

## Execution

Start your MongoDB instance at the port `27017`.

Download or clone this repository (using the Git tool) and place it in a directory of your preference. For example:

* On Windows: `c:\\fatequino`
* On Linux: `$HOME/fatequino`

Create an environment variable named `FLASK_APP` contaning the value `my_flask_app.py`

Using a command line tool access the chatbot's directory, for example:

* On Windows: `c:\\fatequino\Interação 1`
* On Linux: `$HOME/fatequino/Interação\ 1/`


Install the applications dependencies running this command on the command line: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. In case of error, maybe you should try to install the dependencies one by one.

> Note: Maybe you'll have to run the command above as system administrator (super user).

Run the `python -m flask run` command to execute the program.

After these steps, the application can be accessed using the `localhost:5000` address on your browser.
